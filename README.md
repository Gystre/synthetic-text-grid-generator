# synthetic-text-grid-generator

Creates grids of text and exports them in yolo v5 compatible datasets. If you want more fonts to be chosen from, just drag the .ttf file into the fonts folder. Also, I don't have the license to any of these fonts so use at your own risk ig lol

## Ex

![really cool image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/200994742782132224/991782277828845678/9FQ-sm_sq_15x15_f44px_p8px_Arial.jpg)

## Todo:

-   creates really small objects sometimes (fix with bigger font sizes?)
-   bounding box sometimes out of bounds (tall letters generated on the last row sometimes get cut off)
