# synthetic-text-grid-generator

Creates grids of text and exports them in yolo v5 compatible datasets. If you want more fonts to be chosen from, just drag the .ttf (must be .ttf extension) file into the fonts folder. Also, I don't have the license to any of these fonts so use at your own risk ig lol

## Todo:
